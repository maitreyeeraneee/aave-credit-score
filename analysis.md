### Score Distribution & Behavior Analysis

- Majority of wallets score between 600â€“800.
- Wallets scoring above 900 had no liquidations, high repays, and regular deposits.
- Wallets below 200 had very few repayments and multiple liquidations, indicating risky behavior or bots.
- The scoring logic is rule-based and can be extended by adding more features like frequency or time gaps between actions.
